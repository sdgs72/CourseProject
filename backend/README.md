# Backend Setup

1. Have python 3.7.x/3.8.x installed
2. python packages necessary to run are located in requirements.txt, run pip3 install -r requirements.txt to install necessary packages
3. use ./run to run the flask server (this will use port 5000, please make sure that port 5000 is not used by anyone, we don't support env port loading since the front end is hardcoded to look into port 5000 specficly)
